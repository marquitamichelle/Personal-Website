<h2 style="color:aliceblue;font-family: cursive;">Developer</h2>
<p style="color:aliceblue;font-family: cursive;">My name is Michelle I'm a Software Engineer.I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform.
<h2 style="color:aliceblue;font-family: cursive;">Mother</h2>
<p style="color:aliceblue;font-family: cursive;">But the best job I've ever had is the job of being a mom. It is by far the most valued position I've ever held. That said, motherhood is definitely the most challenging of any job on the market and it involves the most work.
    <h2 style="color:aliceblue;font-family: cursive;">Yogi</h2> 
<p style="color:aliceblue;font-family: cursive;">Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects.
